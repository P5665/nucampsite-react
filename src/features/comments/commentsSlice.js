/*
When using createSlice(), you need to pass an object that defines the initial state, the reducers, and the slice name. Here's what you need to pass to createSlice():

initialState:
This is the initial state of the slice of the Redux store that the createSlice() will manage. It's a plain JavaScript object that represents the initial data for this slice.

reducers:
An object where each property is a reducer function. These reducer functions define how the state should change in response to different actions. The keys of the object will be used as the action type strings.

sliceName:
A string that represents the name of the slice. It's used to automatically generate action type strings based on the slice name.

			const newComment = {
